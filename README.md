# POSIX Shell

This project is a POSIX compliant shell that's capable of interpreting shell commands.
It's also capable of running external programs and builtin commands like cd, pwd, echo and more.
Building this project helped me learn about shell command parsing, REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

## How to run the app:

The entry point for the `shell` implementation is in `app/main.py`.

1. Ensure you have `python (3.11)` installed locally
2. Run `./run.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in `app/main.py`.
